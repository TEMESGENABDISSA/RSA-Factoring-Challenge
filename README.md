# Description
he RSA Factoring Challenge was a renowned cryptographic contest that aimed to encourage advancements in number theory and computational methods for factoring large integers. 
Introduced in 1991 by RSA Security, the challenge involved the factorization of specific semiprime numbers, which were generated using the RSA encryption algorithm. 
The primary objective was to promote research and development in the field of public-key cryptography and to assess the feasibility of breaking RSA encryption through the factorization of large numbers.
The challenge spurred significant progress in factoring algorithms, and several participants successfully solved the challenge problems, contributing to the improvement of cryptographic techniques and the understanding of computational complexity.
